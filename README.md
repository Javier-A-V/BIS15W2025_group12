This project was developed collaboratively by Javier Vidal, Isaac Benitez, Dexuan Zhu, and Joyce Lin. Originally hosted at https://github.com/JoyceLin914/BIS15W2025_group12.git.
My primary contributions included building the interactive map for the Shiny app, performing data analysis, and cleaning and organizing the dataset.
